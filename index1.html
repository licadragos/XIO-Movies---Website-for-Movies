				<h1>XIO Movies Terms of Use</h1>
				<p>XIO provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access entertainment content ("XIO content") over the Internet on certain  Internet-connected TVs, computers and other devices ("XIO ready devices").<br/>
				These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As used in these Terms of Use, "XIO service", "our service" or "the service" means the personalized service provided by XIO for discovering and accessing XIO content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service.</p>
				<h3>1. Membership</h3>
				<p>1.1. Your XIO membership will continue until terminated. To use the XIO service you must have Internet access and a XIO ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. "Payment Method" means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below).
				<br />
				<br />
				1.2. We may offer a number of membership plans, including memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your XIO membership by visiting the xiomovies.com website and clicking on the "Account" link available at the top of the pages under your profile name.</p>
				<h3>2. Promotional Offers</h3>
				<p>We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships (“Offers”). Offer eligibility is determined by XIO at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer and put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent XIO membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers. We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent XIO membership to determine Offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the Offer or in other communications made available to you.</p>
				<h3>3. Billing and Cancellation</h3>
				<p>3.1. Billing Cycle. The membership fee for the XIO service will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the  "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the xiomovies.com website and click on the "Billing details" link on the "Account" page to see your next payment date. If you signed up for XIO using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your XIO membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.
				<br />
				<br />
				3.2. Payment Methods. To use the XIO service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.		
				<br />
				<br />
				3.3. Updating your Payment Methods. You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).
				<br />
				<br />
				3.4. Cancellation. You can cancel your XIO membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the XIO service through the end of your billing period. Payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused XIO content. To cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you signed up for XIO using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your XIO membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the XIO service through that third party.
				<br />
				<br />
				3.5. Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans. We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you.</p>
				<h3>4. XIO Movies Service</h3> 
				<p>4.1. You must be at least 18 years of age to become a member of the XIO service. Minors may only use the service under the supervision of an adult.
				<br />
				<br />
				4.2. The XIO service and any content accessed through the service are for your personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with individuals beyond your household. During your XIO membership we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access the XIO service and XIO content. Except for the foregoing, no right, title or interest shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use the service for public performances.
				<br />
				<br />
				4.3. You may access the XIO content primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content. The content that may be available will vary by geographic location and will change from time to time. The number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription plan and is specified on the "Account" page.
				<br />
				<br />
				4.4. The XIO service, including the content library, is regularly updated. In addition, we continually test various aspects of our service, including our websites, user interfaces, promotional features and availability of XIO content. You can turn off test participation at any time by visiting the "Account" page and changing the "Test participation" settings.
				<br />
				<br />
				4.5. Some XIO content is available for temporary download and offline viewing on certain supported devices ("Offline Titles"). Limitations apply, including restrictions on the number of Offline Titles per account, the maximum number of devices that can contain Offline Titles, the time period within which you will need to begin viewing Offline Titles and how long the Offline Titles will remain accessible. Some Offline Titles may not be playable in certain countries and if you go online in a country where you would not be able to stream that Offline Title, the Offline Title will not be playable while you are in that country.
				<br />
				<br />
				4.6. You agree not to archive, reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform, publish, license, create derivative works from, offer for sale, or use (except as explicitly authorized in these Terms of Use) content and information contained on or obtained from or through the XIO service. You also agree not to: circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any of the content protections in the XIO service; use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the XIO service; decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any software or other products or processes accessible through the XIO service; insert any code or product or manipulate the content of the XIO service in any way; or use any data mining, data gathering or extraction method. In addition, you agree not to upload, post, e-mail or otherwise send or transmit any material designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment associated with the XIO service, including any software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs. We may terminate or restrict your use of our service if you violate these Terms of Use or are engaged in illegal or fraudulent use of the service.
				<br />
				<br />
				4.7. The quality of the display of the XIO content may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection. HD, Ultra HD and HDR availability is subject to your Internet service and device capabilities. Not all content is available in all formats, such as HD, Ultra HD and HDR, and not all subscription plans allow you to receive content in all formats. Default playback settings on cellular networks exclude HD, Ultra HD and HDR content. The minimum connection speed for SD quality is 1.0 Mbps; however, we recommend a faster connection for improved video quality. A download speed of at least 3.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive HD content (defined as a resolution of 720p or higher). A download speed of at least 15.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Ultra HD (defined as a resolution of 4K or higher). You are responsible for all Internet access charges. Please check with your Internet provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges. The time it takes to begin watching XIO content will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time, the content you have selected and the configuration of your XIO ready device.
				<br />
				<br />
				4.8. XIO software is developed by, or for, XIO and may solely be used for authorized streaming and to access XIO content through XIO ready devices. This software may vary by device and medium, and functionalities and features may also differ between devices. You acknowledge that the use of the service may require third party software that is subject to third party licenses. You agree that you may automatically receive updated versions of the XIO software and related third-party software.</p>
				<h3>5. Passwords and Account Access</h3>
				<p>The member who created the XIO account and whose Payment Method is charged (the "Account Owner") is responsible for any activity that occurs through the XIO account. To maintain control over the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the account (which would include information on viewing history for the account), the Account Owner should maintain control over the XIO ready devices that are used to access the service and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone. You are responsible for updating and maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account. We can terminate your account or place your account on hold in order to protect you, XIO or our partners from identity theft or other fraudulent activity.</p>
				<h3>6. Miscellaneous</h3>
				<p>6.1. Governing Law. These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands. These terms will not limit any consumer protection rights that you may be entitled to under the mandatory laws of your country of residence.
				<br />
				<br />
				6.2. Unsolicited Materials. XIO does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas for XIO content, and is not responsible for the similarity of any of its content or programming in any media to materials or ideas transmitted to XIO.
				<br />
				<br />
				6.3. Customer Support. To find more information about our service and its features or if you need assistance with your account, please visit the XIO Help Center, which is accessible through the xiomovies.com website. In certain instances, Customer Service may best be able to assist you by using a remote access support tool through which we have full access to your computer. If you do not want us to have this access, you should not consent to support through the remote access tool, and we will assist you through other means.
				<br />
				<br />
				6.4. Survival. If any provision or provisions of these Terms of Use shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
				<br />
				<br />
				6.5. Changes to Terms of Use. XIO Movies may, from time to time, change these Terms of Use. We will notify you at least 30 days before such changes apply to you.
				<br />
				<br />
				6.6. Electronic Communications. We will send you information relating to your account (e.g. payment authorizations, invoices, changes in password or Payment Method, confirmation messages, notices) in electronic form only, for example via emails to your email address provided during registration.</p>
