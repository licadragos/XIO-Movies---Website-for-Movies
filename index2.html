<br>            <h3>Use of Information
<br>            </h3>
<br>            <p>We use information to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts, to manage member referrals, to process your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and
<br>                other topics. For example, we use such information to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
<br>                    <p>determine your general geographic location, provide localized content, provide you with customized and personalized viewing recommendations for movies and TV shows we think will be of interest to you, determine your ISP to support
<br>                        network troubleshooting for you (we also use aggregated ISP information for operational and business purposes), and help us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests; </p>
                </li>
                <li>
<br>                    <p>coordinate with Partners on making the XIO service available to members and providing information to non members about the availability of the XIO service, based on the specific relationship you have with the Partner;
<br>                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
<br>                    <p>secure our systems, prevent fraud and help us protect the security of XIO accounts;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
<br>                    <p>prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, and to enforce our terms (such as determining whether and for which XIO signup offers you are eligible and determining whether a particular
<br>                        device is permitted to use the account consistent with our Terms of Use);</p>
                </li>
                <li>
<br>                    <p>analyze and understand our audience, improve our service (including our user interface experiences and service performance) and optimize content selection, recommendation algorithms and delivery;
<br>                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
<br>                    <p>communicate with you concerning our service so that we can send you news about XIO, details about new features and content available on XIO, special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys, and to assist you with
<br>                        operational requests such as password reset requests. These communications may be by various methods, such as email, push notifications, text message, online messaging channels, and matched identifier communications (described
<br>                        below). Please see the "Your Choices" section of this Privacy Statement to learn how to set or change your communications preferences.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
<br>            <p><br>Our recommendations system strives to predict what you will be in the mood to watch when you log in. However, our recommendations system does not infer or attach socio-demographic information (like gender or race) to you. We have a Help
<br>                article that explains how our recommendations system works - spoilers: the biggest driver of recommendations is what you actually choose to watch through our service. You can read the article at <a href="#">www.XIO.com/recommendations</a>.
<br>            </p>
<br>            <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Statement will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect and use it. We will normally collect personal
<br>                information from you where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (for example, to provide our services to you), where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests
<br>                or fundamental rights and freedoms (for example, our direct marketing activities in accordance with your preferences), or where we have your consent to do so (for example, for you to participate in certain consumer insights activities
<br>                like specific surveys and focus groups). In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person
<br>                (for example, to prevent payment fraud or confirm your identity). For questions about our use of your personal information (including legal bases and transfer mechanisms we rely on), cookies or similar technologies, please contact our
<br>                Data Protection Officer/Privacy Office by email at <a href="#">privacy@XIO.com</a>. Please visit our online help center at <a href="#">help.XIO.com</a> for more information about
<br>                these topics.

<br>                        or other payment methods, to provide customer service, to analyze and enhance data (including data about users' interactions with our service), and to process and administer consumer surveys. In the course of providing such
<br>                        services, these Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services (which includes maintaining
<br>                        and improving their services). </p>

<br>                    <p><strong>Partners:</strong> As described above, you may have a relationship with one or more of our Partners, in which case we may share certain information with them in order to coordinate with them on providing the XIO service
<br>                        to members and providing information about the availability of the XIO service. For example, depending on what Partner services you use, we may share information:

                    <ul>
                        <li>

<br>                            <p>so that content and features available in the XIO service can be suggested to you in the Partner’s user interface. For members, these suggestions are part of the XIO service and may include customized and personalized
<br>                                viewing recommendations.

<br>                    <p><strong>Promotional offers:</strong> We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for your participation, will require us to share your information with third parties. In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share

<br>                    <p><strong>Protection of XIO and others:</strong> XIO and its Service Providers may disclose and otherwise use your personal and other information where we or they reasonably believe such disclosure is needed to (a) satisfy any
<br>                        applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal
<br>                        activities (including payment fraud), security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of XIO, its users or the public, as required or permitted by law.

<br>                    <p><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transfer of assets, we will transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party
<br>                        agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Statement.
<br>                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
<br>            <p>Whenever in the course of sharing information we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area and other regions with comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure that the information is transferred
<br>                in accordance with this Privacy Statement and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection.
<br>            </p>
<br>            <p>You may also choose to disclose your information in the following ways:
<br>            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
<br>                    <p>certain portions of our service may contain a tool which gives you the option to share information by email, text message and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and applications on your smart device;
<br>                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
<br>                    <p>social plugins and similar technologies allow you to share information; and </p>

                <li>
<br>                    <p>through XIO game features, such as multiplayer options and leaderboards.
<br>                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
<br>            <p>Social plugins and social applications are operated by the social networks themselves, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. Similarly, some of the XIO game features mentioned above (such as multiplayer gameplay,
<br>                leaderboards, and game saving options) may require use of a third-party service, which is subject to that service’s terms of use and privacy policy.&nbsp;</p>

                <li>
<br>                    <p><strong>“Remember me” function:</strong> For ease of access to your account, you can use the "Remember me on this device" function when you log in to the website. This function uses technology that enables us to provide direct
<br>                        account access and to help administer the XIO service without requiring reentry of any password or other user identification when your browser revisits the service.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
<br>                    <p><strong>Giving others access to your account:</strong> If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to see shows you have watched, ratings, account information (including your email address
<br>                        or other information in the "Account" area of our website), and game related information (such as your in-game name and saved game progress). This remains true even if you use our profiles feature. You might have the
<br>                        option to use seamless account login through the XIO mobile app, which enables login to the XIO app on smart TVs, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices on the Wi-Fi network to which you are connected. If you
<br>                        use that feature, those devices will remain signed into your account unless you later log out of those devices.</p>
                </li>
               <li>
<br>                    <p><strong>Profiles:</strong> Profiles allow users to have a distinct, personalized XIO experience, built around the movies and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available
<br>                        to everyone who uses your XIO account, so that anyone with access to your XIO account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles. You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish
<br>                        them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number or other information to the profile and will be provided with notice of collection
<br>                        and use at the time such information is requested (the Profile Privacy Notice applies (<a href="#">help.XIO.com/legal/profileprivacy</a>)). We have various parental controls available,

                <li>
<br>                    <p><strong>Removing device access to your XIO account:</strong> To remove access to your XIO account from your devices, visit the "Account" section of our website, choose "Sign out of all devices," and follow
<br>                        the instructions to deactivate your devices (note, deactivation may not occur immediately). Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or XIO
<br>                        ready device, you should log out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your
<br>                        account, including your personal information.</p>

<br>            <h3>Your Choices
            </h3>
<br>            <p><strong>Email and Text Messages.</strong> If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email or text message, simply access the "Communications Settings" option in the "Account" section of our website
<br>                and uncheck those items to unsubscribe. Alternatively, click the "unsubscribe" link in the email or reply STOP (or as otherwise instructed) to the text message. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from service-related correspondence
<br>                from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.
<br>            </p>
<br>            <p><strong>Push Notifications. </strong>You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from XIO. On some device operating systems, you will be automatically enrolled in the notifications. If you subsequently decide you no longer wish
<br>                to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them off. We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and subsequently decide
<br>                you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your browser’s settings to turn them off. </p>
<br>            <p><strong>WhatsApp.</strong> If you have enabled WhatsApp messages in connection with your XIO account or profile and no longer wish to receive them, you can use your WhatsApp app settings to block them.
<br>            </p>
<br>            <p><strong>Interest-Based Ads.</strong> Interest-based ads are online ads that are tailored to your likely interests based on your use of various apps and websites across the Internet. If you are using a browser, then cookies and web beacons
<br>                can be used to collect information to help determine your likely interests. If you are using a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device that includes a resettable device identifier, then that identifier can be used to help determine
<br>                your likely interests. For your choices about interest-based ads from XIO, please see the "Cookies and Internet Advertising" section (below).
<br>            </p>
<br>            <p><strong>Matched Identifier Communications.</strong> Some third party sites and apps allow us to reach our users with online promotions about our titles and services by sending a privacy protective identifier to the third party. A privacy protective
<br>                identifier means we convert the original information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares the privacy protective identifier to identifiers
<br>                in its database and there will be a match only if you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with XIO and the third party. If there is a match, XIO can then choose whether or not to send a given promotional communication
<br>                to you on that third party site or app, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online advertising. You can opt out in the “Marketing Communications” section of the “Account” section of our website.</p>
<br>
            <h3>Your Information and Rights
<br>            </h3>

<br>                consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time; withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted
<br>                in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent; you have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. Our main establishment within the European Union is in
<br>                the Netherlands. Please visit our online help center at <a href="#">help.XIO.com</a> for more information about these topics.
<br>            </p>
<br>            <p>We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations, including to honor your choices, for our billing or records purposes and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. We take reasonable
<br>                measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a secure manner when it is no longer required.
<br>            </p>
<br>
            <h3>Security
<br>            </h3>
<br>            <p>We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed to provide a level of security
<br>                appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information.
<br>            </p>
<br>            <h3>Other Websites, Platforms and Applications
<br>            </h3>
<br>            <p>The XIO service may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information may differ
<br>                from ours. For example, you may be able to access the XIO service through platforms such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes and a number of other Internet connected devices. These websites and platforms have
<br>                separate and independent privacy or data policies, privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the XIO service.
<br>            </p>
<br>
            <h3>Children

            <h3><span id="cookies">Cookies and Internet Advertising
<br></span></h3>
<br>            <p>We and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons), as well as resettable device identifiers, for various reasons. We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains
<br>                the types of technologies we use, what they do, and your choices regarding their use.&nbsp;</p>
<br>            <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies, web beacons, and resettable device identifiers</strong></p>
<br>            <p>Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these
<br>                other technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons
<br>                associated with those cookies.</p>
<br>            <p>If you use the XIO app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies
<br>                and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the "Identifier for Advertisers" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.
<br>                Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant and for analytics and optimization purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>            <p><strong>Why does XIO use these technologies?</strong></p>
<br>            <p>We use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it easy to access our services by remembering you when you return; to provide, analyze, understand and enhance the use of our services; to enforce our terms, prevent fraud;
<br>                to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site; and to deliver and tailor our marketing or advertising, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and online ads on third party sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>            <p>To help you better understand how we use cookies and resettable device identifiers, please see the information below:</p>
<br>            <ul>
                <li>
<br>                    <p><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use
<br>                        our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
<br>                    <p><strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies help us to customize and enhance your online experience with XIO. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter
<br>                        information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our
<br>                        visitors' use of the XIO service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
<br>                    <p><strong>Advertising cookies and resettable device identifiers:</strong> These cookies and resettable device identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver
<br>                        ads that are more relevant to you and for analytics and optimization purposes. These types of ads are called "interest-based advertising." The advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
<br>            <p>In connection with our use of these technologies, some of the websites and apps where we advertise, as well as advertising technology companies that we use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure our advertisements (collectively “Advertising
<br>                Partners”), may receive limited information from us as part of our campaign targeting, measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps completed in sign-up and site visit or app open/install information).</p>
<br>            <p>Common uses of this type of information are to judge the effectiveness of and optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see when someone who saw an ad later signed up for our service.&nbsp; Another common use is to make sure we
<br>                do not serve ads trying to get individuals to sign up for the XIO service if they are already a XIO user.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>            <p>XIO uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific title selections you make, URLs you land on, or shows you have watched on our service. We do not share information
<br>                about title selections or your shows you have watched on our service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
